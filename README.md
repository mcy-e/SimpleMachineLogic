# ðŸš¦ Elevator and Traffic Light Systems (Logisim Projects)

This repository contains two digital logic design projects created using [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution):

- **Elevator System**
- **Traffic Light System**

Both projects are designed for educational purposes and demonstrate the use of finite state machines (FSM), combinational and sequential logic.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

### 1. ðŸ›— Elevator System

A simple 2-floor or 3-floor elevator model designed with FSM logic. It simulates:

- Button presses (inside and outside the elevator)
- Door open/close mechanism
- Floor transitions
- Idle/waiting states

ðŸ“„ [ElevatorDocumentation.pdf](./Elevator/ElevatorControlSystemDocumentaion.pdf) â€“ detailed explanation of the design.

### 2. ðŸš¥ Traffic Light System

A basic traffic light controller for a 2-way intersection. It features:

- Red, Yellow, Green lights control
- Timer or sensor-based switching logic
- Optional pedestrian signal integration

ðŸ“„ [TrafficLightDocumentation.pdf](./TrafficLight/TrafficLightDocumentation.pdf) â€“ full design details.
